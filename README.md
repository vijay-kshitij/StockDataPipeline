# StockDataPipeline

### In this project, we aim to build a comprehensive pipeline that extracts historical stock data from yfinance, processes the data using Python, and deploys the code on Apache Airflow running on an EC2 instance provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Finally, the processed data will be stored in Amazon S3.
